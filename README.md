# Module_11

## Overview of Project:
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

This new assignment consists of one technical analysis deliverable and a written report. You will submit the following deliverables:

- **Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria**

- **Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)**

Using JavaScript and HTML, you’ll modify the code in your index.html file to create more table filters.

## Results: 

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
